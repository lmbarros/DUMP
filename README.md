# DUMP: Dump of Unsorted Morsels for Programmers

## Vision

* A repository of more or less random programming things
    * Especially implementations of algorithms and data structures.
* If this was really serious, I would make all implementations in The One True Lingua Franca of Computing
    * Too bad I can't stand writing much C anymore.
    * I'll try to at least use C-like languages and not use (too) fancy language features.
    * This probably means that I'll use a subset of (https://dlang.org)[D] for the time being.
* Made for fun and my own education.
    * Needless to say, this is by no means a library of ready-to-reuse stuff.

## Contents

### Morsels

The "programming things" *per se*.

* Euclidean Algorithm: [Notes](morsels/euclidean_algorithm/euclidean_algorithm.md) | [Code](morsels/euclidean_algorithm/euclidean_algorithm.d)


### Plates

Stuff made with the morsels: examples, demos, visualizations, benchmarks... (and, maybe, a metaphor taken too far.)
