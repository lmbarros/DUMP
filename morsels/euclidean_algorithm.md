# Euclidean Algorithm

**Given two numbers, find their greatest common divider (GCD).**

Popularized by Euclid's Elements (circa 300 BC) but possibly discovered at least a handful of decades earlier, it is one of the oldest algorithms still regularly used.

Wikipedia gives a good way to visualize this algorithm in action. You want to compute the GCD of two numbers, *a* and *b*. Start picturing a rectangle measuring *a*×*b*. Finding the GCD is equivalent to finding the size of the largest square tile that could be used to fully cover this rectangle.
